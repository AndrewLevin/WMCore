Use pylint and the pylint test file located under:
WMCORE/standards/.pylintrc

Test files need to be located under WMCORE/test/python/ and
need to mirror the structure you use for the packages under
WMCORE/src/python where every directory and test file is 
augmented with a _t

E.g.: if you have a package:

src/python/WMCORE/MsgService/MsgService.py

you will have a test in the pacakge:

test/python/WMCORE_t/MsgService_t/MsgService_t.py
