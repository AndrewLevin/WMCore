Installing:

Make sure you have CherryPy >= 3.1 and Cheetah >= 2.0.1 (might work with a lower
version but I've not tested it) and that they are on the PYTHONPATH

Get WMCore from CVS/CMS RPM (http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/COMP/WMCORE/)

Edit start.sh to correctly point to where you have these located

Running:
source start.sh and then run ./Root.py and point your browser to http://localhost:8080
