Complete SecurePage class - decide on how best to do it

Make starting better than ./Root.py - that could be done on an application level
Use multiple namespaces for loading classes (e.g. enable running WMCore/WebTools/Controllers and SiteDB/SiteList)

Support all CherryPy configurables from config file
Implement verbose running (set logging level via this switch?)

Implement maintenance for views

Correct minification of javascript
Implement image support in controllers
Let controllers serve files from directories instead of per file - needed for YUI or any other library
Framework to define FRAMEWORK_ROOT for location of base css/js

Write unit tests
Determine what other functionality is needed for the framework (json/xml serialisers?)
