Complete SecurePage class - decide on how best to do it
		probably write a custom tool, hooked into before_handler
		
Make starting better than ./Root.py - that could be done on an application level
Use multiple namespaces for loading classes (e.g. enable running WMCore/WebTools/Controllers and SiteDB/SiteList)

Support all CherryPy configurables from config file
Implement verbose running (set logging level via this switch?)
Improve config passing to classes (configure method?)
		think about config vs context
		minimise config to just the relevant pieces
		
Implement maintenance for views

Correct minification of javascript
Implement image support in controllers
Let controllers serve files from directories instead of per file - needed for YUI or any other library
Framework to define FRAMEWORK_ROOT for location of base css/js

Write unit tests

Determine what other functionality is needed for the framework (json/xml serialisers?)

For REST/API type interactions calculate and set etag
		tool hooked into before_finalise I think
